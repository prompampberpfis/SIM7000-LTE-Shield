However, buying the DLC from the official store can be expensive, especially if you already own other DLCs. That's why some people prefer to download it from torrent sites, which offer the game files for free. However, this method has some risks and drawbacks that you should be aware of before you proceed.
 
First of all, downloading games from torrent sites is illegal and can get you in trouble with the law. You might face fines or even jail time if you are caught. Secondly, torrent sites are often unsafe and can infect your computer with malware or viruses. You might end up losing your personal data or damaging your system. Thirdly, torrent downloads are usually incomplete or outdated and can cause errors or crashes when you try to play the game. You might also miss out on updates, patches and online features that are available only for legitimate buyers.
